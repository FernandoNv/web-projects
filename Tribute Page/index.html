        <p class="content-p">
            Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. 
            <br>
            <br>
            He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. He played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>School</strong> - Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently</li>
            <li><strong>Christopher Morcom</strong> - Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom (1911 â€“ 1930), who has been described as Turing's "first love". </li>
            <li><strong>University</strong> - He was awarded first-class honours in mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal life</strong> - Turing were charged with "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. He was convicted and had to do hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido.</li>
            <li><strong>Death</strong> - Dies at age 41</li>
        </ul>
